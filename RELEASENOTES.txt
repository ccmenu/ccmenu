CCMenu Release Notes

CCMenu 15.0

* Native support for Apple Silicon Macs.
* New mode for menu bar icon. In this mode, the icon uses colour when at
  least one build is failing. Otherwise it uses the black and white variant.
* Slightly darkened the green icons to increase contrast in tinted menus.
* Built with hardened runtime settings.
* Fix for redirect requests when authentication must be pushed.
* Fix for problems with non-Gregorian calendars.


CCMenu 14.0

* Advanced preferences now have a check box to set whether CCMenu should
  open automatically when logging in. This is functionally the same as adding
  CCMenu to the login items in System Preferences.
* The sheet to add new projects is now resizable so that large list and long
  project names can be managed.


CCMenu 13.0

* Projects can now be given a display name that is shown instead of the name
  the project has on the Continuous Integration server.
* CCMenu now registers its own URL schemes. This makes it possible to create
  links on webpages that, when clicked, will open CCMenu and show a prefilled
  list of projects to add (see website for details).
* When adding or removing projects, the build timing for other projects is
  now retained.
* It is now possible to use a proxy when accessing CI servers that require
  authentication. Attempting this before triggered a bug in Apple's libraries,
  and this version of CCMenu adds a workaround for that bug.


CCMenu 12.1

* Fix for incompatibility with OS X 10.8/10.9 that was introduced in
  CCMenu 12.0.


CCMenu 12.0

* When not displaying black and white icons, the use of symbols is now
  optional for states in which the server is idle . This makes it possible to
  revert to the display style used before the introduction of the new icons.
* Notifications can be sent when a build is starting on the server.
* Projects with a successful last build can be hidden from the menu.
* When sorting projects alphabetically case is now ignored.
* Authentication works with Cloudbees servers.
* Failed build count is shown with the correct font for the menu bar.


CCMenu 11.0

* New icons based on Ionicons, providing more contrast and symbols in addition
  to colour.
* Black and white mode for status menu item.
* New menu item to retrieve status from servers.
* Fixes an issue with project URLs containing a fragment.


CCMenu 1.10.3

* Fixes a recently introduced bug that made the keyboard shortcuts for cut,
  copy, paste inactive.


CCMenu 1.10.2

* Built with App Transport Security disabled for El Capitan so that servers
  that aren't offering HTTPS or use self-signed certificates can be used, too.
* Fixed a bug that could prevent CCMenu from opening project URLs that contain
  spaces or other special characters.
* Fixed display of application menu that is shown when the preferences panel
  is open and CCMenu displays the application icon in the dock.


CCMenu 1.10.1

* Fixed a bug that could occur when adding projects from a server that
  requires authentication.
  
  
CCMenu 1.10

* It is now possible to select for which build results user notifications
  are displayed. Sounds can be chosen independently.
* The app icon is shown in the dock and application switcher when the 
  preferences window is open. This can help with switching in and out of CCMenu
  when copying feed URLs.
* A new advanced preference makes it possible to reject all certificates that
  cannot be verified automatically. Normally CCMenu asks the user how to proceed.


CCMenu 1.9

* Can display last build label in menu. 
* Special workaround for authenticating against Hudson and Jenkins. 
* No longer tries to autocomplete from URL history when typing.
* Using Git SHA as build version.


CCMenu 1.8.1 (SourceForge only)

* Added final reminder about App Store move.


CCMenu 1.8

* Prompt user when server certificate is not trusted.
* Added retina icons. (This was possible because Luke had already created the 
  necessary assets when he still could. In memory of him.)

  Store.

* Nicer display of project list in preferences. 
* Projects can be ordered manually.
