CCMenu Release Notes

CCMenu 12.0

* When not displaying black and white icons, the use of symbols is now
  optional for states in which the server is idle . This makes it possible to
  revert to the display style used before the introduction of the new icons.
* Notifications can be sent when a build is starting on the server.
* Projects with a successful last build can be hidden from the menu.
* When sorting projects alphabetically case is now ignored.
* Authentication works with Cloudbees servers.
* Failed build count is shown with the correct font for the menu bar.


CCMenu 11.0

* New icons based on Ionicons, providing more contrast and symbols in addition
  to colour.
* Black and white mode for status menu item.
* New menu item to retrieve status from servers.
* Fixes an issue with project URLs containing a fragment.


CCMenu 1.10.3

* Fixes a recently introduced bug that made the keyboard shortcuts for cut,
  copy, paste inactive.

* Built with App Transport Security disabled for El Capitan so that servers
  that aren't offering HTTPS or use self-signed certificates can be used, too.
* Fixed a bug that could prevent CCMenu from opening project URLs that contain
  spaces or other special characters.
* Fixed display of application menu that is shown when the preferences panel
  is open and CCMenu displays the application icon in the dock.


CCMenu 1.10.1

* Fixed a bug that could occur when adding projects from a server that
  requires authentication.
  
  
CCMenu 1.10

* It is now possible to select for which build results user notifications
  are displayed. Sounds can be chosen independently.
* The app icon is shown in the dock and application switcher when the 
  preferences window is open. This can help with switching in and out of CCMenu
  when copying feed URLs.

  cannot be verified automatically. Normally CCMenu asks the user how to proceed.
