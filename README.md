CCMenu
======

**CCMenu displays the build status of projects on a continuous integration server as an item in the Mac's menu bar. It started as part of the CruiseControl project that built the first continuous integration server.**

IMPORTANT: This repository holds the code for the classic version of CCMenu. It has been retired and replaced with a new version in the [ccmenu/ccmenu2](https://github.com/ccmenu/ccmenu2) repository.

If for some reason you can't use the new version of CCMenu, you can still download releases of the classic version in the [releases](https://github.com/ccmenu/ccmenu/releases) section of this repository. The [documentation](https://ccmenu.org/ccmenu/) is still available, too.
